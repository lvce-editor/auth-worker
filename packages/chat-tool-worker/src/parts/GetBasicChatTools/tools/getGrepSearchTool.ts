If you are not sure what words will appear in the workspace, prefer using regex patterns with alternation (|) or character classes to search for multiple potential words at once instead of making separate searches. For example, use 'function|method|procedure' to look for all of those words at once. Use includePattern to search within files matching a specific pattern, or in a specific file, using a relative path. Use 'includeIgnoredFiles' to include files normally ignored by .gitignore, other ignore files, and `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` settings. Warning: using this may cause the search to be slower, only set it when you want to search in ignored folders like node_modules or build outputs. Use this tool when you want to see an overview of a particular file, instead of using read_file many times to look for code within a file.\n\nIn a multi-root workspace, you can scope the search to a specific workspace folder by using the absolute path to the folder as the includePattern, e.g. /path/to/folder.",
